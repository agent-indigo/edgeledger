# EdgeLedger

## Description

This is the EdgeLedger project from Brad Traversy's 2019 Modern HTML & CSS from the Beginning (Including SASS) course on O'Reilly.

I made the following modifications:

- Migrated the smooth scrolling from jQuery to CSS

- Disabled the Google Maps and other JavaScript functionality
